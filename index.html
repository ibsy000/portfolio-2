            <h1>The Reason I'm Here</h1>

            <h2>Dedicated to my brother; my inspiration and every supportive loved one in my life.</h2>
        
            <div class="reason">
                <p>Growing up, my brother was always the <q><em>techy</em></q> one. He always wanted
                    the newest gaming console or he was learning about computers or 
                    he would take electronics apart and put them back together. I was
                    right there beside him interested in what he was doing or I 
                    was playing video games with him. When I got a little older, my
                    brother passed down an old thick, heavy laptop to me. He taught
                    me how to use emulators to play old games for the N64, NES, 
                    GameBoy, GameCube, and so on. I <b><u>loved</u></b> 
                    that laptop! (I still have it <em>somewhere</em>!) When I 
                    was old enough to get a job in high school I would save up my 
                    wages to buy my own consoles. We started to compete with each
                    other on who would get the newest console first. We actually 
                    still do that to this day. As we got older, my brother started to
                    get really into gaming computers. He started to learn all the
                    ins and outs of what makes a computer function. It was like he
                    was speaking a different language! At this point, I was 
                    focused on schoolwork, work work, and extracurricular activities.
                    We didn't see each other very often then because we had our own
                    things going on.<br><br>
                    <strong><em>>>Fast forward a few years.</em></strong> 
                    At this point, I am engaged to my <em>best-est</em> friend, we 
                    own a home, have three fur-babies, and have stable jobs. I think
                    to myself, <q><em>I should look into gaming computers! It's time to
                    <strong>level up</strong> my gaming! </em></q> I got some advice
                    from my brother and did some of my own research as well. I decided
                    to buy a budget-friendly-VR-capable gaming computer and a VR setup
                    because I had to <b>1-UP</b> my brother, of course. I found my
                    new <b>passion</b>! Not only did I enjoy the entire gaming aspect,
                    but I also spent endless hours going through every directory, 
                    every setting, researching components, always learning. I have
                    fun trying to understand how things work. I utilized my knowledge
                    in my jobs and was always helpful when there were new updates, 
                    software, applications, computers, and so on.<br><br>  
                    <strong><em>>>>Fast fast forward to this year.</em></strong> My
                    fiance and I just finished remodeling our house earlier this year. 
                    We also just recently lost two of our dogs, which was really tough 
                    for both of us. We also had truck problems and a well that 
                    decided to quit working. We were at a point in our lives 
                    where we wanted to make a change. We didn't feel fulfilled in 
                    the area we lived in or with our jobs. At this point, the 
                    housing market is so high we decided to sell our house
                    and <q>retire</q> for a while until the market drops to purchase or
                    build a new home in a new area. We wanted to travel after selling
                    our house but the gas prices also <em>skyrocketed</em>. We don't 
                    want to blow through our profits on gas, that's <b>no fun</b>.
                    Family offered their home to us until we can find a rental property
                    in the meantime. During my free time I was thinking about what
                    my next career path would be. Then I stumbled upon the <em>
                    answer!</em> I saw an advertisement online for Career Karma and
                    my first thoughts were, <em><q>This is a scam. This has got to be
                    a scam. Go to a bootcamp and get certified in a tech field in 
                    less than a year? I have to see if this is legit.</q></em><br><br> After
                    some research, I came to the conclusion that it's not a scam. I
                    signed up, attended a few live sessions explaining bootcamps and the
                    different tech career paths. I felt like this is <em>exactly</em> 
                    what I have been looking for. I talked to my fiance first to see
                    what he thinks about it and he supports me 100%! I began researching
                    bootcamps to find the right one for me. After looking at a few
                    options, I found <strong><u>Coding Temple</u></strong>. This school
                    stood out right away. They are transparent about what they have
                    to offer throughout the entire website. By the end of reviewing
                    their page, I only had one question, <q><b>Where do I sign up?</b>
                    </q> The enrollment process was so easy, quick, and streamlined. 
                    <br><br>I explained my plans to my family, my fiance's family, 
                    and my friends. My brother says to me, <q><em>Welcome to the 
                    nerd club.</em></q> They have all been super supportive and have
                    been cheering me on for success! I am so <strong>excited
                    </strong> about learning everything I can about software engineering 
                    in this cohort. So far, the pre-work has been a little 
                    overwhelming and stressful, but ultimately it's been really <em>
                    fun</em> for me. I never want to stop learning! After this cohort,
                    I plan on getting a job in the industry for a while and  
                    continue learning new tech paths. My ultimate goal is to learn 
                    how to make my own video games and continue to do that until
                    I'm ready to really <em><b>retire!</b></em>
